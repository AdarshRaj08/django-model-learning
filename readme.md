# Django Model Inheritance and Custom Managers

Welcome to my repository where I document my learning journey on Django model inheritance and custom managers. This project is divided into two main apps: **Inheritance** and **Manager**.

## Project Structure

1. **Inheritance App**: Focuses on various types of model inheritance in Django.
2. **Manager App**: Explores the creation and usage of custom managers in Django models.
